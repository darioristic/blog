I'm Dario Ristić — a technology and business executive with over two decades
of experience building digital products, cloud platforms, and companies from
the ground up. My career has been dedicated to connecting cutting-edge technology
with genuine business value — creating systems that enable sustainable growth,
organizational adaptability, and measurable long-term impact.

My journey started early. In my teens, I began advocating for Linux and
teaching others to use open-source systems. This ignited a lifelong passion
for open-source software and modern infrastructure that would define my entire
professional path. What began as sharing knowledge in my local community evolved
into a career building some of the first cloud platforms in Southeast Europe.

Today, as co-founder and CEO of Cloud Native d.o.o., I lead a team focused on
helping organizations modernize their infrastructure and embrace open,
automated, and scalable cloud-native technologies. What sets my work apart is
the fusion of deep technical expertise with strategic business leadership —
I don't just build systems; I build systems that drive real business outcomes.

I'm deeply involved in the cloud and open-source community beyond my day-to-day
work. Over the years, I've contributed extensively to growing regional tech
ecosystems, supported countless developer communities, and spoken at major
conferences about cloud-native architecture, DevOps culture, and the transformative
power of open collaboration. My core belief: knowledge must circulate freely.
Innovation doesn't happen in isolation — it thrives when brilliant minds share
ideas and build together.

My leadership experience spans critical roles at major organizations. I led
innovation and business development at Comtrade System Integration, where I
worked on groundbreaking projects involving artificial intelligence,
event-driven architectures, and cutting-edge technologies that pushed the
boundaries of what was possible. Before that, I directed the Regional Cloud Department
at SBB – United Group, where we engineered one of the first comprehensive
regional cloud platforms spanning Serbia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina
— a project that demonstrated the real-world potential of cloud infrastructure
at scale.

The foundation of my expertise comes from co-founding several pioneering cloud
ventures, including SezamPro Hosting and Ehost. As early leaders in managed
hosting and OpenStack-based cloud infrastructure across Southeast Europe,
these companies proved that open-source technology could compete with — and
often outpace — proprietary solutions when built with passion and community
support. These formative experiences solidified my conviction that technology
must remain open, transparent, and community-driven.

Whether I'm consulting enterprise leaders on cloud strategy, speaking at
international tech conferences, or writing about the intersection of technology
and organizational transformation, my mission remains consistent: empowering
teams and companies to reach their full potential through better technology
choices and smarter infrastructure decisions.

The future of technology is collaborative, open, and built on principles of
innovation that serve both businesses and communities.
