I’m Dario Ristić — a technology and business executive with over
twenty years of experience in building digital products, cloud platforms,
and companies from the ground up. My focus is on connecting technology
with real business value — creating systems that enable growth,
adaptability, and long-term impact.

I spent my early teens advocating for and teaching people how to use
Linux and later developed a passion for Open Source and modern infrastructure.

As founder and CEO of Cloud Native d.o.o., I lead a team dedicated to helping
organizations modernize their infrastructure and embrace open, automated, and
scalable cloud-native technologies. My background combines deep technical
understanding with strategic leadership, allowing me to bridge innovation
and execution in equal measure.

I’m also a cloud evangelist and active member of the open-source community.
Over the years, I’ve contributed to growing regional tech ecosystems, supporting
developer communities, and speaking at events about the power of cloud-native
architecture, DevOps culture, and open collaboration. I believe knowledge should
circulate freely — innovation thrives when shared.

Earlier in my career, I led innovation and business development at
Comtrade System Integration, working on projects involving artificial
intelligence, event-driven data, and new and innovation technologies. Before
that, I directed the Cloud Department at SBB – United Group, where we
built one of the first regional cloud platforms
across Serbia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

I’ve co-founded several early cloud ventures, including SezamPro Hosting
and Ehost, pioneers of managed hosting and OpenStack-based cloud infrastructure
in Southeast Europe. These experiences shaped my belief that technology should
stay open, transparent, and driven by community — because the best ideas are
built together.
