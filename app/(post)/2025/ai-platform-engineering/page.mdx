Platform Engineering is the pattern that successful organizations use. Sometimes, people have this shortsighted view that platform engineering is only about building infrastructure and pipelines to deploy apps to Kubernetes. Platform engineering is about building abstractions over infrastructure, tools, and processes that help teams deliver value more efficiently.

Yesterday, it was about Kubernetes. Today, it is also about providing access to approved LLM models, RAG mechanisms, vector databases, caching, model versioning, and connectors to legacy data sources, hence AI Platform Engineering.
