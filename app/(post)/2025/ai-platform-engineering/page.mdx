Platform Engineering is the pattern that successful organizations use. Sometimes, people have this shortsighted view that platform engineering is only about building infrastructure and pipelines to deploy apps to Kubernetes. Platform engineering is about building abstractions over infrastructure, tools, and processes that help teams deliver value more efficiently.

Yesterday, it was about Kubernetes. Today, it is also about providing access to approved LLM models, RAG mechanisms, vector databases, caching, model versioning, and connectors to legacy data sources, hence AI Platform Engineering.

## The Evolution

When I started working with platform engineering in the early days of cloud-native transformation, the focus was clear: abstract away the complexity of deploying applications to Kubernetes. Build the pipelines, set up the CI/CD, create the development environments—make it easy for teams to ship software.

But technology moves fast, and so do the needs of our organizations. We've now entered an era where AI capabilities are becoming core to every application. The question isn't whether your organization will adopt AI—it's how quickly and effectively.

## What Makes AI Platform Engineering Different

Traditional platform engineering gave you abstractions for:
- Container orchestration
- Service discovery
- Load balancing
- Storage and databases
- Deployment pipelines

AI Platform Engineering extends these abstractions to include:

**Model Management**: Approved LLM models with proper governance and usage tracking
**RAG Capabilities**: Vector databases and retrieval mechanisms that teams can use without becoming experts
**Intelligent Caching**: Caching strategies aware of token limits and model responses
**Model Versioning**: Tracking and managing different model versions, A/B testing capabilities
**Legacy Connectors**: Integration with existing data sources that weren't built for AI workloads

## Why This Matters

The transition from traditional platform engineering to AI Platform Engineering isn't just about adding new tools—it's about recognizing that AI is becoming infrastructure. Just like we abstracted away the details of container orchestration, we need to abstract away the complexity of working with AI models.

Teams shouldn't need to know the difference between GPT-4 and Claude, or understand vector embeddings, to build intelligent features. That's what AI Platform Engineering delivers: the ability to build AI-powered applications without becoming an AI expert.

## My Experience

In my journey building platforms for cloud-native organizations, I've seen this pattern repeat itself. The organizations that succeed are the ones that provide the right abstractions at the right time. Kubernetes became the abstraction for container orchestration. Now, we need abstractions for AI capabilities.

The work we're doing today with AI Platform Engineering is exactly that—creating the foundational layer that will enable teams to build intelligent applications without getting lost in the complexity of AI infrastructure.
