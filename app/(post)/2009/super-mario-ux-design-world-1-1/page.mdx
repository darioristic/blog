# Super Mario UX: The Design of World 1-1

In this video, Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka discuss World 1-1, or the very first level in the very first Super Mario Bros. It's fascinating how every element on the level is designed to introduce you to a mechanic of the game, or how Mario moves and jumps.

This is interesting if you like Mario, but also important for any developer in any medium who is thinking about the **NUX (new user experience)** of their product.

The genius of World 1-1 lies in its progressive disclosure. Every block, enemy, and obstacle serves a purpose beyond mere decoration. The level doesn't tell you what to do — it shows you, naturally guiding players through discovery.

## The Elements of Great Onboarding

1. **Visual Cues**: The first enemies you encounter are Goombas — slow, predictable, and positioned in a way that makes the solution obvious.

2. **Fail-Safe Design**: Early obstacles are designed to be forgiving. You can't die from the first few challenges, giving players room to experiment and learn.

3. **Progressive Complexity**: Each new screen introduces just one new element at a time — a ? block, a pipe, moving enemies, platforms at different heights.

4. **Natural Pedagogy**: By the time players reach the flagpole, they've unconsciously learned everything they need to know about Mario's movement — running, jumping, power-ups, and enemy behavior.

This approach applies to software, websites, mobile apps, or any product. The best onboarding experiences don't need a tutorial — they teach through interaction, just like World 1-1.
